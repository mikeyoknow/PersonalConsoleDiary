# PersonalConsoleDiary
Personal Diary using Python.
By implementing the learnings on Task Manager project, I will test my skills on a different purpose

# What I Learned!
* Understanding and usage of Python's built-in modules: **os** and **datetime**.
* Object-oriented programming in Python: classes, objects, methods.
* Working with files in Python: creating, writing, reading, and checking file existence.
* User interaction and input validation in Python.
* User authentication: implementing signup and login process in a console-based application.
* Password hashing: using bcrypt library for secure password storage.
* Understanding why password hashing is important.
* Incorporating external user inputs into the application (diary entries).
* Exception handling in Python: particularly handling ValueError.
* Use of Python decorators: understanding @staticmethod.
